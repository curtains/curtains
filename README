Hacking
-------

I haven't gotten around to documenting this code yet, but if you have any
question, send them to me personally <contact@tejerodgers.com>.

Run test.py to see a test window. You can modify it to play around with the
event system, but that is pretty much all you can do at this point.

Work to be done
---------------

A lot. There has to be a better place where this can actually be discussed.


Coding standards
----------------

Official standards haven't been established yet, but here are the guidelines I've
been using:

    * wrap lines at 80 characters where possible.
    * function names are in lower case with different words separated by _
    * same goes for method names, variables and properties.
    * private methods have underscores in front and behind.
    * private classes are in all lowercase, public classes are in title case.
      (no underscores for either)
